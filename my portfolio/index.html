                        About Me
                        <br>
                        My name is Emmanuele La Duca and I'm a determined young man with a passion for computers and
                        technology.
                        I graduated from IPSIA (MAT - Technical Maintenance and Assistance) in Termini Imerese, a school
                        that
                        provided me with a solid technical and practical background. I'm currently pursuing my education
                        in
                        computer science engineering and artificial intelligence by attending the Epicode degree
                        program, which
                        is allowing me to expand my skills and tackle the most advanced challenges in the programming
                        world.

                        Since I was young, I've always had a passion for the digital world and creating innovative
                        solutions. I
                        enjoy challenging myself, tackling complex problems, and pushing my limits. I believe that
                        personal
                        progress is the result of constant commitment and curiosity. Therefore, I'm always looking for
                        new
                        opportunities to learn, grow, and improve.

                        Career Goals
                        <br>

                        My primary goal is to become a versatile programming professional, with a focus on creating
                        mobile apps
                        for Android and iOS, desktop software, video game development, and data analysis and more. I
                        want to be
                        able to apply my skills to diverse and challenging projects, ranging from technology to
                        entertainment.

                        Another dream of mine is to share my passion for programming by creating and publishing training
                        courses
                        on Udemy, helping others enter the world of technology and IT. I believe that education is one
                        of the
                        most powerful tools for changing the future, and I'd like to contribute to this cause.

                        I'm also very interested in collaborating with companies across different industries, using my
                        skills to
                        solve real-world problems and drive innovation. I'd also like to explore other creative fields,
                        such as
                        interior design and yacht design, which fascinate me and where I'd like to apply my innovative
                        spirit
                        and passion for technological design.

                        Biography
                        <br>

                        I'm a curious and determined young man with a passion for computer science and programming. I
                        love taking on new challenges and testing myself, because I believe that's the only way to truly
                        grow and exceed one's expectations. Every day I try to learn something new, whether it's a new
                        programming language or an emerging technology. I enjoy reading and staying up-to-date on what's
                        happening in the world of technology.

                        Outside of work, I love exercising to maintain a healthy physical and mental balance. I believe
                        a healthy body is essential for a healthy mind, and this principle guides me in all areas of my
                        life.

                        I believe there's no limit to what we can learn and achieve. That's why I continue to invest
                        time and energy in learning more about programming in all its aspects: from the most popular
                        languages ​​to the most advanced frameworks. Programming for me isn't just a job, but a true
                        passion that drives me to never stop and always strive for improvement.

                            <p>Address: Via Falcone e Borsellino, Termini Imerese, Italy. I developed a small project
                                using an Arduino board, which consisted of a parking system controlled by sensors
                                capable of detecting not only how many parking spots are free or occupied through LED
                                indicators, but also displaying on an LCD screen how many cars have entered and how many
                                spots are occupied. I graduated with a grade of 93/100.</p>

                            <p>From May 2022 to December 2022, I had the opportunity to participate in a group project
                                that allowed me to deepen and practically apply various backend technologies. In
                                particular, I worked with Java for developing application logic, Spring for creating a
                                structured and modular architecture, and SQL for managing and querying the database.
                                This project gave me the chance to collaborate with other team members, discuss
                                technical choices, divide responsibilities, and actively contribute to the development
                                of real features, improving both my technical skills and my teamwork abilities.</p>

                            <p>From June 2023 to August 2023, I had the opportunity to deepen and develop skills in
                                backend development with Microsoft technologies. During this period, I focused on using
                                C# for object-oriented programming, LINQ for advanced data query management, and ASP.NET
                                Core for building modern, high-performance, and scalable web applications. Additionally,
                                I worked with Entity Framework, which allowed me to understand and use the ORM paradigm
                                to interact efficiently with the database. This experience provided me with a solid
                                technical foundation and a more comprehensive view of software development in the .NET
